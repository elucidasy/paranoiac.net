                  Octavia Butler's <i>Parable of the Sower</i> imagines a
 world that has been ravaged by climate disaster, laissez-faire 
capitalism, and a society that has lost its humanity. Thematically, the 
book is very focused on empathy as an extension of our humanity. Lauren,
 the protagonist of the book, has a condition called <i>hyperempathy</i> that causes her to feel the physical pain of others which, in <i>Parable</i>'s
 world means that she is at a disadvantage, hindering her ability to 
fight and defend herself. Lauren's hyperempathy is a large focus of the 
book and becomes the driver for many critical moments in her story, 
despite being a condition that should really spell her certain death in 
the uncaring, hostile world <i>Parable</i> takes place in. In fact, 
Lauren's ability to empathize becomes crucial to the formation of her 
personal philosophy or quasi-religion, <i>Earthseed</i>, which asserts 
that God is not an entity that controls everything but rather change 
itself. Her constructed religion attracts followers, forming a community
 of people connected not only by their shared experiences, but by their 
differences as well. Octavia Butler uses the speculative fiction format 
to emphasize the importance of empathy and compassion in a world where 
it is increasingly rare, not out self-interest but a genuine care for 
mutual survival. The importance Butler places on community highlights 
the driving force for the survival of humanity: compassion for one 
another. <i>Parable</i>'s world necessitates compassion and empathy when so much of it has given into the apathy that fuels its own destruction.

                  The 2016 sci-fi drama, <i>Arrival</i>, follows Amy 
Adams' character, Louise Banks, attempting to communicate with aliens 
that have arrived on earth in massive spaceships. The alien "heptapods" 
speak through symbols communicated through the heptapods' limbs. <i>Arrival</i>, like <i>Parable of the Sower</i>,
 is about the role empathy and compassion play in humanity's survival, 
focusing on its importance not only in our actions but our language. <i>Arrival</i>
 posits that compassion is the framework that language needs to be 
constructed in to ensure humanity's future in the face of division. 
Furthermore, the movie asserts that fighting for a future for the ones 
we love, no matter how hard it may be, is how we survive as a 
collective.

              The heptapods of <i>Arrival</i> have the ability to 
transcend space and time, showing Louise visions of her future which 
drives the plot towards its conclusion. Through these visions, Louise is
 able to show the other countries of <i>Arrival</i>'s world that the 
heptapods are not malicious and only want to help humanity. By the 
conclusion, the heptapods' have profoundly affected <i>Arrival</i>'s world, shaping it into a heterotopia<span>—</span>a world that is not defined by its uniformity or homogeny but by its differences. The heptapods are an <i>Other</i><span>—</span>literally alien, foreign<span>—</span>forcing
 humanity to reconcile its preconceptions of the danger that the Other 
presents, challenging it to substitute fear with compassion. They are 
initially a looming, ominous, presence in their first appearance in the 
film, but eventually become a symbol for the future they come from; a 
hopeful future whose world has been shaped by empathy, compassion, and 
love.

              In 2019, glass beach released <i>the first glass beach album</i>,
 a jazz, punk, prog-rock, pop fusion record that is as original and 
inventive as it is an emotional experience. In the fifth track, <i>neon glow</i>,
 singer-songwriter J McClendon sings about nuclear annihilations and 
aliens coming to earth, inspired by the fringe Trotskyist ideology, 
Posadism, which combines Marxist theory with UFO speculation. According 
to McClendon, the song's structure is intentionally ambiguous about 
whether humanity is saved by the UFOs of the song or destroyed by them, 
contrasting <i>Arrival</i>'s optimistic message. But while <i>neon glow</i>'s lyrics are a melancholy departure from the optimism of <i>Arrival</i>, the characters in the song, much like <i>Parable</i> and <i>Arrival</i>, are driven by love.

              A common thread throughout speculative fiction about the 
future of humanity is the importance that is placed on empathy, 
compassion, and love as tools for humanity's survival. I think these 
themes are incredibly important to explore in the contemporary age 
because they allow us to reflect on the structures we are familiar with 
today critically.
